This is a project created to demonstrate an old time dial-up modem. <br>
This part (modulator) is the first out of two. The second part is an android app. it can be found at: https://github.com/danelboikis/Demodulator2.git .<br>
This part is the modulator. You can configure the message along with other configurations by editing the file "config.properties". Make sure to change the configurations of the second part accordingly as it is installed on a different device. <br>
The data is passed to the second part of the project (demodulator) by sound, using the FSK modulation scheme. <br>
